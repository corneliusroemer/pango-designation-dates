# Pango lineage designation dates

This repository attempts to collect the dates on which each Pango lineage was designated.

Unfortunately, there is no file in the pango-designation repo that mentions the date a lineage was added so we have to go dig into the git history (please tell me if there's a better way).

## How to run

```bash
python get_designation_date.py
```

## Possible approaches

- Find first mention in `lineages.csv` file, need to step through history commit by commit and see when a lineage was first mentioned
- First mention in `lineage_notes.txt`: use lineages that are present in `lineages.csv` as basis for search
- First mention in commit message: use lineages in `lineages.csv` as basis for search

Try all of the above and use the earliest date. Expect that designation will be earliest.

## Issues

`lineages.csv` only started in February 2021, before need another source of truth

## Output

- `lineage_designation_dates.csv` - CSV file with lineage, date, commit hash and designation release it was first part of

## Uses

- Put as coloring on Nextclade reference trees
